## Motivations

Formed as an internal tool for [Sparrow Design](https://sparrow-design.com/) to manage our growing local environment. It saved us a lot of time during complex setups, I've often needed to do all this to experiment locally:
- Run the `./apps/web` frontend on port `21351`.
- Run the `./apps/admin` frontend on port `54267`.
- Build and watch the `./shared` folder.
- Build and watch the `./backend` service on port `5001`.
- Run the Firebase emulator.

Initially we handled this by opening multiple terminals or using a script to run all of them (including developing a minimal UI to visually display them). But those solutions did too little, or too much. We needed a way to select which packages and services will be running, and a way to organize their ports.

We developed BASE_ to provide a web UI to manage everything you need from your local environment. We're aiming on supporting everything you would want from a local environment.
